Yes, you need to install Trivy on your Jenkins agent/server for the Scan Docker Image stage to work.
Trivy is a command-line tool and must be available in the system PATH where the Jenkins job runs.

What you need to do:
Install Trivy on your Jenkins agent/server
For Ubuntu, run:



sudo apt-get install wget apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release

echo deb https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install trivy


No extra Jenkins configuration is needed
As long as Trivy is installed and available in the PATH, your pipeline stage will work.

(Optional) Test Trivy installation
Run trivy --version on your Jenkins agent/server to confirm it is installed.
